								<h4>When you purchase one of our Mobile Applications</h4>
								<br />
								<p class="text-muted">
									When you download an Application, we may have access to certain information as permitted by the application store provider (such as the Apple App Store or Google Play). Generally, this information is only order related and includes an order number, game purchased and other related information. Where necessary, the application store provider may allow us to access certain other order related information for us to respond to a support enquiry. This is generally limited to an email address that you will have already provided to us so that we can respond to your support request. Accessing this data allows us to validate your purchase and respond to your particular request. We don’t store, share or sell this data, it stays on the Application Store Providers servers, of which we have no control over.
								<br /><br />
								Below are links to the Application store providers privacy policies that host our Applications:

										  	<h3>Cookies and Web hosting</h3>
										 	<hr class="my-4">
											
											<h4>What are Cookies and why we don’t use them?</h4>
											<p class="text-muted">
												Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your device by websites and mobile applications. Cookies have a number of uses, from storing your login details in order to aid faster access to password protected areas, to cookies that have unique elements that can be used to track all kinds of your personal data. We don’t have password protected areas within our website or our mobile applications and we don’t like the idea of ourselves or third parties tracking you, therefore we don’t facilitate the use of any form of cookie.</p>
									<br /><br />
									<hr class="my-4">
									<h4>Third party Web Hosting provider</h4>
									<p class="text-muted">
										We use GitHub Pages for hosting our website. GitHub Pages do not inject cookies into the website they host, and as we also do not use cookies, you can be confident our Website does not store any type of cookie on your computer. Our Mobile Applications never store cookies. Please be aware that GitHub may collect “personal data” from visitors to our Website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service. For more details please read <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement
">GitHub’s Privacy Policy</a>.<br /><br />

									Where do GitHub host websites?
									<br /><br />
										GitHub store and process data that they collect in the United States. <br /><br />GitHub Headquarters are located at: <br /><br />GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.<br />GitHub B.V., Vijzelstraat 68-72, 1017 HL Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
									<br /><br />
									<hr class="my-4">
									<h3>What “non personal data” do we access?</h3>
									<hr class="my-4">
									<p class="text-muted">
										For clarity, here are some examples of non personal data we may access when using our Mobile Applications:<br /><br />
										Operating system<br />
										Our Mobile Applications are built on a single code base, therefore at times within the code we may need to check if you are running our Mobile Application on a Google device (Android) or an Apple device (iOS). We do this in order to facilitate system dependent features. We never store, share or sell any of this data.
										<br /><br />
										Language Settings<br />
										When you launch one of our Mobile Applications, we may access your device’s language settings, in order for the Application to run in the same language as your device. We never store, share or sell this data, it is only accessed when you run one of our Mobile Applications.
										<br /><br />
										
										Device Time and Date Information<br />
										When using our Mobile Applications, we may access your devices Time and Date information. We access this information only when needed. An example would be our Solitaire application, which reads your device’s date and time in order to create an in-game calendar which displays daily challenges. Again we never store, share or sell this data, and it will only be accessed when you run one of our Mobile Applications.</p>
										<br /><br />
										<hr class="my-4">

											<h3>Safeguarding Children (COPPA)</h3>
											<hr class="my-4">
											<p class="text-muted">
												We believe safeguarding a child’s “personal data” should go without saying. Therefore we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA”).</p>
												<br /><br />
												<p class="text-muted">What is COPPA?
												<br /><br />
												COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.
												<br /><br />
												How Jenetic complies with COPPA
												<br /><br />
												We comply with COPPA by never storing, sharing or selling any “personal data” when you use our Website or Mobile Applications, regardless of whether you are a child or an adult. 
												<br /><br />
												We request, if you are under the age of Thirteen (13), and you would like to get in touch with us by email, please have a parent or guardian do this on your behalf.
												<br /><br />
												If you believe that we may have received an email from a child under the age of thirteen (13), please contact us immediately so we can delete this information from our Gmail account.
